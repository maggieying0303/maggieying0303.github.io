  <p>Due to Non-Disclosure Agreement, I am unable to show the full details of my work here. Please <a href="mailto:ry78@cornell.edu" target="_blank" class="accent-bofa"> contact me </a>for more details if you would like to learn more!</p>

  <p>On a high level, I was tasked with the goal to improve the iPad experience of <a class="accent-bofa" href="https://apps.apple.com/jm/app/mymerrill/id420490216" target="_blank">MyMerrill</a>, a financial advising app serving over 250k households, by better utilizing the form factor as well as new iOS 14 capabilities. Throughout my 4 weeks, I worked conducted research and synthesized existing findings, worked closely with product owners and technology partners, and designed and prototypes a new navigation structure to tackle the main problem. </p>

  <p><strong>my learnings</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Never hesitate to ask!</strong> As junior designers that just onboarded to a new team, we might not know a lot —— but that could be one of our biggest advantage, as it means that we are able to view problems with fresh eyes and that others are willing to teach us. Seizing this special opportunity, I was constantly pinning my manager and my design buddy with various questions. Personally, I found that asking questions was the most effective method to gain valuable insights as well as target roadblocks.  </p></li>

    <li><p><strong> In a remote setting, it's more important to be proactive than ever.</strong> As workplaces are moving online, we no longer enjoy the privilege of being able to peak over others shoulder to stay updated of their work progress or have quick conversations in the hallway. Therefore, it is up to us to actively message others and set up meetings to keep everyone involved in the project on the same page.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Designing for an unfamiliar group of users —— </strong> In my prior experiences, I was mostly designing products for college students like myself, and it is very easy to understand their needs and mindsets. This summer, however, my user groups are clients in a completely different age group and financial status. With this challenge, I relied much more research insights, both quantitative and qualitative, to understand their goals properly.</p></li>
